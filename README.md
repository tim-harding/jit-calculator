# JIT Calculator

A [Cranelift](https://cranelift.dev/)-backed, JIT-compiled, very basic calculator, made in response to a [nerd snipe](https://ochagavia.nl/blog/the-jit-calculator-challenge/) from Adolfo Ochagav√≠a.

## Results

Benchmark results are from running the program `+*-/--**++//`:

| Implementation | CPU       | Runtime (ms) |
|----------------|-----------|-------------:|
| Interpreter    | AMD 5700X |         17.0 |
| JIT            | AMD 5700X |          2.9 |
| Interpreter    | Apple M1  |         11.5 |
| JIT            | Apple M1  |          1.5 |
